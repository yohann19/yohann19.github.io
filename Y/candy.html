                <p id="p" class="1h-base">The history of cake dates back to ancient times. The first
                    cakes were very
                    different from what we eat
                    today. They were more bread-like and sweetened with honey. Nuts and dried fruits were often added.
                    According to the food historians, the ancient Egyptians were the first culture to show evidence of
                    advanced baking skills. The Oxford English Dictionary traces the English word cake back to the 13th
                    century. It is a derivation of 'kaka', an Old Norse word. Medieval European bakers often made
                    fruitcakes and gingerbread. These foods could last for many months.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    According to the food historians, the precursors of modern cakes (round ones with icing) were first
                    baked in Europe sometime in the mid-17th century. This is due to primarily to advances in technology
                    (more reliable ovens, manufacture/availability of food molds) and ingredient availability (refined
                    sugar). At that time cake hoops--round molds for shaping cakes that were placed on flat baking
                    trays--were popular. They could be made of metal, wood or paper. Some were adjustable. Cake pans
                    were sometimes used. The first icing were usually a boiled composition of the finest available
                    sugar, egg whites and [sometimes] flavorings. This icing was poured on the cake. The cake was then
                    returned to the oven for a while. When removed the icing cooled quickly to form a hard, glossy
                    [ice-like] covering. Many cakes made at this time still contained dried fruits (raisins, currants,
                    citrons).

                    <h2>Cake & gateau: definitions & examples</h2>
                    <p id="p">"Cakes and gateaux. Although both terms can be used for savoury preparations (meat
                        cakes or
                        vegetable gateaux) their main use is for sweet baked goods. Cakes can be large or small,
                        plain
                        of fancy, light or rich. Gateau is generally used for fancy, but light or rich, often with
                        fresh
                        decoration, such as fresh fruit or whipped cream. Whereas a cake may remain fresh for
                        several
                        days after baking or even improve with keeping, a gateau usually includes fresh decoration
                        or
                        ingredients that do not keep well, such as fresh fruit or whipped cream. In France, the word
                        'gateau' designates various patisserie items based on puff pastry, shortcrust pastry (basic
                        pie
                        dough), sweet pastry, pate saglee, choux pastry, Genoese and whisked sponges and
                        meringue...The
                        word 'gateau' is derived from the Old French wastel, meaning 'food'. The first gateau were
                        simply flat round cakes made with flour and water, but over the centuries these were
                        enriched
                        with honey, eggs, spices, butter, cream and milk. From the very earliest items, a large
                        number
                        of French provinces have produced cakes for which they are noted. Thus Artois had gateau
                        razis,
                        and Bournonnais the ancient tartes de fromage broye, de creme et de moyeau d'oeulz. Hearth
                        cakes
                        are still made in Normandy, Picardy, Poitou and in some provinces in the south of France.
                        They
                        are variously called fouaces, fouaches, fouees or fouyasses, according to the
                        district...Among
                        the many pastries which were in high favor from the 12th to the 15th centuries in Paris and
                        other cities were: echaudes, of which two variants, the falgeols and the gobets, were
                        especially
                        prized by the people of Paris; and darioles, small tartlets covered with narrow strips of
                        pastry...Casse-museau is a hard dry pastry still made today'...petits choux and gateaux
                        feuilletes are mentioned in a charter by Robert, Bishop of Amiens in 1311.</p>
